Data Science Essentials Lab CSC-570

1.  Pull the Boston Housing notebook I've created for this assignment.<br>  

2.  Impliment scikit learn's r2 and mse methods to measure the performance of my linear regressor.<br>

3.  Impliment either sklearn.linear_model.Ridge or sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.<br>
4.  Optimize (by reviewing the r2 and mse scores and adjusting the regularization paramater) the regression model you pick.<br>
5.  Turn in the github link to your work <br>
